# An Afterword on Commissions — We are not only losing

The article is also available in [Chinese]({{< ref "opinion/old.md">}}).

I don’t have a favorite character. I started commissioning mostly to spend money on those cold, no-one-will-draw-this ideas. Some characters have painfully few images. Uh, I don’t think I have a better reason.

A friend once asked, “Why not use AI? It doesn’t cost much to run.” He had a point. And with my passable Linux skills, setting one up was easy enough. But after trying it, using an AI image as a wallpaper just felt… off.

I guess a wallpaper is a placeholder for joy. And if we’re talking about joy, dopamine counts. But who accepts AI-generated dopamine? Maybe that protein-folding AI could pull it off. So people like me who are allergic to `AI-generated` just end up paying. I should’ve just told him: “The tag `AI-generated` itself makes me uncomfortable.”

I have a habit of rationalizing my actions. That’s how I arrived at all of this. If an action can’t be rationalized, it’s either not worth thinking about or I haven’t gotten around to it yet. These are the actions that curdle into questions, the ones that whisper, “Why didn’t you do it differently?” Eventually, they become regrets. And we all die with them. But I already tried an AI wallpaper centuries ago. Decided I didn’t like it. So on this, at least, I have no regrets.

A great many regrets stem from not finding porn of your favorite anime character to masturbate to. Scientists and mathematicians used their brains to make AI art. While those two sentences aren’t related, AI does help people with niche tastes fulfill their sexual fantasies. Some even say it reduces sexual harassment. Either way, implementing Homo sapiens’ desires is, in itself, all well and good.

But most of what gets made is still one person in the frame. It seems we’re still in an era where AI can’t even get `solo focus` right. Often, `looking at viewer`. It’s strange. You’d think we’d have moved past this, but we’re still stuck. And yes, I know—getting a `group sex` scene right is hard. In fact, it’s one of the hardest things for any artist to draw. They’re hard for models and they’re hard for human artists. Bodies overlap. Poses have to lock. Hands need somewhere to go. Light must land on all of it. One miss and the whole thing looks wrong. Yet while everyone is busy arguing about which model is better, the quality of `group sex` images isn’t improving at all. Clearly AI was born into an era where even toes have to be censored. We used to see things so wild that even Danbooru couldn’t tag them; now even `foot focus` gets shot down because the community doesn’t approve. AI art was born a bit too late.

Well, I did a quick check, `ControlNet` can handle multiple people now. Should make things easier, but we keep polishing solos. AI art was supposed to help us make more varied, imaginative things. Since we’re still arguing about which model draws better fingers, we probably won’t.

Back in the SD 1.5 days, public opinion was split clean in two: for or against. Everybody knows that the automobile wasn’t invented to cause accidents. Killing people is just a side effect. Cars split humanity in half. One is watching; the other has already been hit. The scene is too gruesome; nobody wants to look at the victims.

It hit me that commissioning art is an ancient practice. I don’t major in history, but emperors definitely paid people to paint. They’d also stare at these paintings as wallpapers. Modern people are changing now. A poor family that once could only afford a rotting pumpkin can now buy factory-fresh instant noodles. Our technological progress has been truly remarkable.

Meanwhile, a tired mother who just finished overtime picks up her daughter at school. School let out early today; mom was late, and to make up for it she decides to take her daughter to browse in a stationery shop. The little girl has always loved to draw; she spots a children’s picture book and asks mom to buy it. At checkout, the mother notices this children’s book costs only three bucks. She can’t help but marvel: our technological progress has been truly remarkable.
